        <p> Far away in another realm, a magic forest exists. Rumors say that mythical creatures roam the forest at night. What exists in the magic forest? Bats, cats, and other creatures . Many thought the stories of a magical forest were made up. They saw it as a myth. But the tales of magical creatures were real and were all true. The creatures that existed in this forest lived in the same way as any other forest. In fact, they were just as real as anyone else. And the magical beings in that forest existed on a level above humans.
